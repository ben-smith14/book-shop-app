# book-shop-app

This is an Android app that uses a local database to keep track of the inventory in a book shop. A list of the current inventory can be seen on the main screen and clicking on a book will show its details in an additional activity where these attributes can be edited.

The focus in this project was on setting up the local database correctly and interacting with it through the main UI activities. A ContentProvider and contract class were created to keep access to the database controlled and to possibly allow other apps to access it in the future.

This project was another of the significant tasks assigned to us in the Android Basics Nanodegree on udacity.com. Screenshots of it running can be seen below:
